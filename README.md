# Eat the Burger!

A burger logger utilizes MySQL, Express, and Handlebars to allow users to create, update, and read burgers from the database.

## How this App works

* Eat the Burger! is a logger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* * Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
