## How this App works

![Homepage](./screenshots/burger-showlist.png)
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

![Order a burger](./screenshots/burger-order.png)
* The user can input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

![Waiting area](./screenshots/burger-waiting.png)
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

![Database](./screenshots/burger-database.png)
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
